# LaTeX Templates
This repository contains three folders:
1. `sample_homework` gives a sample LaTeX homework format file. It includes all of the packages and macros that I'd standardly use for importing purposes, including problem/solution environments.
2. `sample_paper` gives a sample LaTeX paper/project format file. It includes all of the packages and macros that I'd standardly use for importing purposes, including a sample BibTeX file.
3. `sample_slides` gives a sample LaTeX slide format file via Beamer. It includes all of the packages and macros that I'd standardly use for importing purposes.

The outputs are all given as PDFs, which I have included in the relevant folders. Note that the hyperlink formatting is not visible here (e.g. in the `samplepaper.tex`), although it is when you download the pdf. This is due to the fact that Github does not display the pdfs as a pdfs. These are **not** meant to serve as introductions to LaTeX, but rather to give usable templates. I occasionally did give some sample code (e.g. using figures in `sample_slides.tex`, showing my remark environment in `sample_paper.tex`, etc.).
