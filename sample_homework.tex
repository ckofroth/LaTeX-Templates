Here is a \LaTeX\ template for your homework, if you feel so inclined to use it.

\problem{3.15}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Put part a here.
    \item Put part b here. 
\end{enumerate} 

\solution{3.15a}: Put a solution here. \qed

\solution{3.15b}: Maybe we need an intermediate lemma.
\begin{lem}
Put the lemma here.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma]
Prove the lemma.
\end{proof}
See the included packages to view the commands for theorem (``Th"), proposition (``prop"), etc. Now, you can continue with your solution of Exercise 3.15b. Cool, proof complete. \qed
